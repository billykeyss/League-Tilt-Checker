Program/Tutorial Built by Bill Huang.

BEFORE YOU RUN THE PROGRAM

Before doing anything, we need to install a module called "requests".  It allows the program to grab data from Riots API.  Without it, the program WILL NOT WORK.

STEP ONE
Download Python Version 2.7.10: https://www.python.org/downloads/

STEP TWO
In your Terminal change your directory (using the "cd" command) to where my program and all its files are. For example, if the file is on your Desktop type in: cd C:\Users\(ENTER YOUR COMPUTERS NAME HERE)\Desktop\Tut 

STEP THREE
We need to install pip. So once your in my programs directory, type in: python get-pip.py

STEP FOUR
Install requests. Simply type in "pip install requests"
